# Two methods
Intersection has two methods and are implemented in two Actions. 
One is in hw_h (hash, -m1) and one is in hw_s (sort, -m2).

# Important
before make config under hardware directory, 
You need to create a symbolic link "hw" points to either "hw_s" or "hw_h"
depending on the method you want to test.
